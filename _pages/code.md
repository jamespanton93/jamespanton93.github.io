## TERRA

TERRA is a numerical mantle convection model, originally developed by [Baumgardner J. (1985)] (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01008348). It has since been developed into a robust and versatile code used for addressing questions on mantle dynamics, structure and composition. Below are examples of scripts which I have created to analyse TERRA output and generate figures. 

### Pb pseudo-isochron age
The Pb pseudo-isochron is 

## NASA API scripts
As a fun learning project I have created some simple tools for accessing information using NASA's APIs. In order to use them you will need an API key which are [freely available] (https://api.nasa.gov/) upon request.

This page will shortly be updated with example code for processing TERRA output and also with other goodies.
