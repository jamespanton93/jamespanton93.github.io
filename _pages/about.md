I am a geodynamicist at Cardiff University, specialising in the use of spherical numerial geodynamic models. I recently submitted my PhD thesis, titled "Advances in using three-dimensional mantle convection models to address geochemical problems", and have now started as a research associate at Cardiff University on the NERC Large Grant, Mantle Convection Constrained (MC2). Please see my [research page](https://jamespanton93.github.io/research/) for information on my past and present work.
