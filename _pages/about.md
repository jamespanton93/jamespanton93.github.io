I am a geodynamicist at Cardiff University, specialising in the use of numerical mantle convection models. I completed my PhD at Cardiff University in 2021 and am now a research associate at the same institution, working on the NERC Large Grant, [Mantle Convection Constrained (MC2)](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FT012633%2F1). Please see my [research page](https://jamespanton93.github.io/research/) for information on my past and present work. On the [code page](https://jamespanton93.github.io/code/) you will find examples of scripts which I have written for post processing of TERRA output as well as some scripts written just for fun.
