<h2>PhD</h2>

I studied as a PhD student at Cardiff Universiy from 2016-2020 on the NERC funded [Deep Volatiles](http://www.deepvolatiles.org/) project. My research involded reconicling long-standing geochemical observations in 3D numerical geodynamic models. Specific geochemical constraints considered are:
* The Pb pseudo-isochron age of oceanic basalts
* He and Ar composition of oceanic basalts
* Present day <sup>3</sup>He degassing rate
* Atmospheric <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar
