<h2>Research Associate Cardiff University</h2>

I am currently working on the NERC funded grant, [Mantle Circulation Constrained](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FT012633%2F1), lead by Huw Davies at Cardiff University. My role involes code development on TERRA (a 3D mantle convection code), developing post-processing tools, and running mantle circulation models constrained by plate reconstructions. These models will be used to investigate the origins of large igenous provinces (LIPs).

<h2>PhD</h2>

I studied as a PhD student at Cardiff University from 2016-2020 on the NERC funded [Deep Volatiles](http://www.deepvolatiles.org/) project. My research involded reconicling long-standing geochemical observations in 3D numerical geodynamic models. Specific geochemical constraints considered are:
* The Pb pseudo-isochron age of oceanic basalts
* He and Ar composition of oceanic basalts
* Present day <sup>3</sup>He degassing rate
* Atmospheric <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar

My thesis is titled 'Advances in using three-dimensional mantle convection models to address global geochemical cycles' and is availble [here](http://orca.cf.ac.uk/138329/).
